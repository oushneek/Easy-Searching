     \'Easy Searching\' is an\n
     application for searching datas\n
     inside the phone memory.\n\n
     You can search for\n
     Images,Videos,Musics,\n
     Applications and other files\n
     through this application.\n\n
     
     Search :\n
     Selecting a category you will\n
     get all the files in that one in a\n
     list.Then you can put the name\n
     and get the desired one or you\n
     can just scroll up and down to\n
     find it.\n\n
     
     Open :\n
     To open a file you just have to\n
     tap the screen once.\n\n
     
     If any default player is not\n
     selected or can not be found\n
     you will be asked for chosing\n
     one.Here we recommend you\n
     to prefer the \'just once\' option \n
     after chosing a player.\n
     Otherwise it may try to open\n
     all the files with it which may\n
     not be possible.\n\n
     THANK YOU FOR USING THIS \n
     APPLICATION.
